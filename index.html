            <h3>Latte</h3>
            <p>A latte is a popular coffee drink made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk, typically topped with a small amount of milk foam. The ratio of milk to espresso is high, giving it a creamy texture and mild coffee flavor. Lattes are often enjoyed with flavorings like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut, and can be served hot or iced.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="coffee">
            <h3>Macchiato</h3>
            <p>Macchiato is an Italian coffee drink that means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian. It's typically made with a small amount of espresso and a small amount of milk, giving it a stronger coffee flavor compared to drinks with more milk, like lattes or cappuccinos.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="coffee">
            <h3>Expresso</h3>
            <p>Espresso is a concentrated coffee brewed by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans at high pressure. It forms the base for many popular coffee drinks and is known for its rich, intense flavor and creamy consistency.</p>
